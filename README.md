# Campaign Moodshirt 
This webpage is part of my schoolwork. We created imaginary campaings for non-existent products. 
My campaign is about t-shirt that can change its colors depending on your current mood.
Now we are going to use this webpage to learn how to work with Google analytics.
You can see the result here: https://pslib-cz.github.io/2020l4web-campaign-hanatvrznikova/
